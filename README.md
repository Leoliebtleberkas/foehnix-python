# Foehnix
is a software tool for Foehn classification written in both R and python.
It is still under development and especially this code here is still missing bigger chunks. We are looking forward to push or first release candidate (version 1.0) in the first half of 2019.

# R Version
The R package is at this stage more mature then this python version and can be found here:
- https://github.com/retostauffer/Rfoehnix

# Documentation
There will be a python specific documentation at some point. But at the moment please have a look at: http://retostauffer.github.io/Rfoehnix  
There you will find general details, examples and the R specific documentation.  

A very beta documentation can be found here
https://matthiasdusch.github.io/foehnix-python

Note: `ellboegen_test_case.ipynb` more or less reproduces the example from https://retostauffer.github.io/Rfoehnix/articles/foehnix.html .
