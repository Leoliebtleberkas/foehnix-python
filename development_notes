Logistic regression
   - Which package to use? Scikit-learn, statsmodels, pandas?  
   - Dependencies vs. Performance
   - Statsmodels gives the smoothest results I think


Description of the statistical model
   - could use `patsy` for R-similar syntax
      https://patsy.readthedocs.io/
   - but doesn't really look 'phytonic' on the first glance

Is the LogisticRegression and the initialization part of the Main-Class
   or is it part of the fitting Function?

   So it's either:
   myclass = SimpleFhoenClassification(data, y, omega, ddsector, upstream, ...)
   myclass.fit()

   Or:
   myclass = SimpleFhoenClassification(data, ddsector, upstream, ...)
   myclass.fit(y, omega)

   I think I like the second one better
